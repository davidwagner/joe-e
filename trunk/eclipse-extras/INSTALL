Installation instructions for the Command Line Joe-E Verifier

Requirements:
(1) A working installation of eclipse including Java development tools
    (3.3 or later)  Any download from eclipse.org will work except the one
    that is specifically for C and C++ development; it just needs to be
    unpacked.

Included in this tarball:
(1) The Joe-E for Eclipse plugin.

(2) The Joe-E library 

(3) The latest version of the Joe-E taming database

(4) The shell script "verify.sh"

Instructions:
(1) You need to install the Joe-E eclipse plugin somewhere that Eclipse
    can find it.  The easiest way to do this is to drop the
    org.joe_e_2.x.x.jar file into the eclipse/dropins directory of an unpacked
    Eclipse tarball from eclipse.org

    For installer or package-manager installed Eclipse installation, the
    location for added plugins varies between distributions.  On Debian,
    plugins can be added on a per-user basis in the
    ~/.eclipse/org.eclipse.sdk.ide/updates/eclipse/plugins directory

    On OS X (for sytemwide installation): Put the plugin file into 
    /Applications/eclipse/plugins/

(2) Edit verify.sh, and fill in the three variables at the top of the file.
    For ECLIPSE_PLUGINS_DIR, make sure you put the global plugins directory,
    which might be different from where you moved the Joe-E plugin to. For the
    other two variables, unless you move the library and taming database
    elsewhere, you can put the full path to the directory containing
    this file.
