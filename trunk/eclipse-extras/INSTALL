Installation instructions for the Command Line Joe-E Verifier

Requirements:
(1) A working installation of eclipse (3.3.x)
(2) The Joe-E for Eclipse plugin. This can be obtained from the joe-e 
    website (www.joe-e.org)
(3) The latest version of the Joe-E taming database and library files. 
    These can also be obtained from the joe-e website.
(4) The shell script "verify.sh". This is also available from the website.

NOTE: (2)-(4) should all be inside this tarball, so you shouldn't have to
      worry about them.

Instructions:
(1) You'll have to move the Joe-E for Eclipse plugin into a plugins directory
    for Eclipse. This directory varies from distribution to distribution.
    
    On Debian: You should have a ~/.eclipse directory 
       	       Or you can put it in your global eclipse installation directory

    If you downloaded the eclipse tarball from the eclipse website, it will be
    in the eclipse/plugins directory, in wherever you unpacked the tarball.

    On OS X: Put the plugin file into /Applications/eclipse/plugins/

(2) Edit verify.sh, and fill in the three variables at the top of the file.
    For ECLIPSE_PLUGINS_DIR, make sure you put the global plugins directory,
    which might be different from where you moved the Joe-E plugin to. For the
    other to variables you can put the full path to the current directory
