Joe-E Plugin for Eclipse
2006.03.24 Snapshot Release

Implemented:
    - checks documented in 2006.03.24 Specification (same as tech report)

Partially Implemented:
    - state management to safely avoid rebuild of entire workspace on
      modification

Some known issues:
    - some handling of generics is overly conservative.
    - doesn't handle inner classes properly (soundness bug!).
    - doesn't yet protect against reading uninitialized values
   
Not yet implemented:
    - taming framework and database

How to use: Import the Joe-E for Eclipse directory to Eclipse as an 
eclipse PDE (Plug-in development environment) project.
