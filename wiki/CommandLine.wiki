#summary Installation and Use instructions for the command-line version of the Joe-E verifier

== Installation and Configuration ==

See GettingStarted for all the details.

== Use ==

Invoke the `verify.sh` script from the root of the directory containing Joe-E
source code to verify, or use the `-source` option to specify a directory
root for the source code.  You may use the `CLASSPATH` environment variable
(or modify `verify.sh`) to specify additional classpath entries required to
compile your code.

The `verify.sh` script takes the following options.  They are actually defined
by the underlying program that the script calls, but their behavior here is
described assuming that verify.sh is used.


|| `-source PATH` || The path to the source classes to be verified. Defaults to the current directory. ||
|| `-taming PATH` || The location of the taming database.  This overrides the setting in verify.sh ||
|| `-classpath PATH_OR_JAR[:PATH_OR_JAR]...` || The compilation classpath, which must include the Joe-E library.  Overrides the setting for the Joe-E library in verify.sh and the CLASSPATH environment variable ||
|| `-markasjoee` ||  Mark all packages as Joe-E packages. ||
|| `-fail` || Fail if any package isn't Joe-E. ||
|| `-verbose` || Enable additional debugging output. ||
