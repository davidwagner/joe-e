# Introduction to Joe-E #

We have written a [scientific paper](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/papers/joe-e-ndss10.pdf) with a detailed overview of Joe-E and its design.
Also, our [poster](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/joe-e/nsf-poster.pdf)
provides a brief overview to Joe-E.

Also, you can find a list of our [scientific publications](Publications.md) on Joe-E.

# Joe-E Language Specification #

The [latest draft of the language spec](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/joe-e/spec-20090918.pdf) is from September 18, 2009.

# Introduction to Object Capabilities #

Joe-E is an object-capability system.  Want some background on object-capability systems?  A short [overview of the object-capability model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model) is available on Wikipedia.  Don't miss Ben Laurie's [introduction to capabilities](http://www.links.org/files/capabilities.pdf) and how they provide a useful approach to access control. For another overview of some work on object-capability systems, you can watch [a survey talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGX2I31OhBE) by David Wagner, or read [his annotated slides](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~daw/talks/TRUST07.pdf).  The [cap-talk mailing list](http://www.eros-os.org/mailman/listinfo/cap-talk) is a good place to discuss the object-capability model, and the
[e-lang mailing list](http://www.eros-os.org/mailman/listinfo/e-lang) is a good place to discuss language-based approaches to object-capabilities (such as Joe-E).
