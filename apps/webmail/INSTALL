Setting up webmail as a tomcat web app

1. check out source from svn. trunk/apps/webmail
2. cd this directory
3. mkdir build
4. mkdir build/WEB-INF
5. mkdir build/WEB-INF/classes
6. mkdir build/WEB-INF/lib
note: you may have to copy web/WEB-INF/web.xml into here. I'm not sure if ant will do it for you.

7. make a build.xml file that is appropriate for your tomcat installation
   There is probably a default one that you can just copy and make minor changes
8. make a build.properties file that is referenced by your build.xml file

9. ant compile
10. start tomcat
11. ant install

12. ant remove when you are done

note: some of this will depend on your tomcat installation
